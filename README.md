This team profile generator was produced by myself using starter code provided
by EdX as part of their Front End Web Development bootcamp. The starter code
included all of the test files, as well as the code in the page-template.js
file and some empty pages with guidance comments to assist in the creation of
classes and importing/exporting module data. All code written in the Employee,
Engineer, Intern and Manager class files, the page-styling file and index.js was
written by me with the exception of the initial lines in index.js up to the
definition of the const renderTeam variable. Additionally, the generated html
files use icons which I had no role in designing.
